          <strong>Visual storytelling</strong> has had my heart since my formative years. Since then, I have been extensively pursuing media production—practicing and creating through different mediums. Video production captivated me from the moment I first picked up iMovie in middle school. I never expected it would become the reason I flew across the Atlantic to study abroad, but there I was.

          <br>
          In my third year studying Visual Communication at Luther, I had the opportunity to study Media Production in Norway at Volda University. Upon arriving, I was instantly captivated by the beautiful northern landscapes and inspired by the creative energy of the town and university. Early on—before classes even began—I found myself in the media room every night, trying to recover from jet lag by designing posters and editing footage of my explorations. It felt like divine inspiration. After six months, I left with countless friends, a deep cultural appreciation, and an ongoing call to create.

          <br>
          Returning to the States, I had a new perspective and significantly more experience in photography, videography, audio engineering, and graphic design. I combined my technical abilities with the immense motivation I gained from my Norwegian peers and dove back into production in the U.S. My project ideas became more ambitious, and by the end of 2024, I had released my first short film and finished my first book.
          <br>
          <br>
          My passion has led me to meaningful connections and wonderful people. I was fortunate to work with the legendary Jane Hawley—filming, editing, and soundtracking video course material for her online class <em>Movement Fundamentals</em>. While juggling hours of content, I also began learning the ropes of UI web development and design, which brings me here—to my page.
